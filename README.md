# fits1

This exercise will introduce non linear data fitting.  The examples will be based on the ROOT libraries.  Similar functionality for everything we see can be found in the numpy + scipy + lmfit + matplotlib modules. But the examples we will follow over the next few projects offer several advantages:
* far more natural histogramming tools
* completely automated fitting options ("one liners")
* convenient methods for defining custom functions and controlling the convergence of the fit
* more detailed and consistent documentation
* and a low level interface to modify the objective function, running in fully optimized compiled code

You are welcome to modify any code for your projects to use other packages.  Where applicable alternate examples will be included. 

* **fit1.C**: C++ function to generate random data according to a normal distroiution with mean=20, sigma=10. <br> A fit is performed using the built in Gaussian model in ROOT.  Then the parameter values, their uncertainteis, and the p-value for the fit are extracted.  To run this code type ```root fit1.C``` or if you are already running ROOT, type ```.X fit1.C```  
* **fit1.py**: The same code using the python interface, run this example using ```python fit1.C```
